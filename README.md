# JavaScript & WebGL Infinite Landscape

This project implements a 3D infinite landscape using random numbers as an initial seed to generate the terrain, which remains consistent until the web browser is refreshed.

Demonstration of the following;

1. 3D Graphics

2. WebGL and HTML Canva

3. Shaders (for basic lighting)

4. Basic Catmull-Rom Spline Path Interpolation

Includes the GL-Matrix JavaScript Library (because I'm lazy and didn't want to roll my own matrix operations);
